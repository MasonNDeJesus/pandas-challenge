    "### The first observable trend would be that Charter school students perform far better than District school students. They usually have a smaller budget as well along with less students. They seem to actually benefit from having less students, even if it means less money. As we can see by the Top Performing Schools Overall, they are all charter schools, while the Bottom Performing Schools are all district schools. It should be noted though that the Charter schools require less money due to having less students, so money doesn't seem to play a role here. It seems more coorelated with the amount of students, and most likely has to do with the teacher:student ratio. Without any further data though, no further analysis can be made.\n",
    "### The second observable trend would be the difference, or rather lack thereof, between each grades reading and math scores. There seems to be no change or improvement, and this remain true for all of the schools. Even charter schools do not improve as you move up in the different grades scores. Math has the lowest of the both math and reading of course, but shows that little to no attempts to improve are made. Why this occurs cannot be determined, as I do not have enough data.\n"
